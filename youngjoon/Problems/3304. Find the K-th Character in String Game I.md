# 3304. Find the K-th Character in String Game I

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".

You are given a positive integer k.

Now Bob will ask Alice to perform the following operation forever:

Generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word.
For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

Return the value of the kth character in word, after enough operations have been done for word to have at least k characters.

Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the operation.

 

> **Example 1**
> 
> Input: k = 5
> 
> Output: "b"
> 
> Explanation:
> 
> Initially, word = "a". We need to do the operation three times:
> 
> Generated string is "b", word becomes "ab".
> 
> Generated string is "bc", word becomes "abbc".
> 
> Generated string is "bccd", word becomes "abbcbccd".

> **Example 2**
> 
> Input: k = 10
> 
> Output: "c"


### Solution(string)
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        // copy previous string & apply function 
        string init = {'a'};
        while((init.size())<k){
            string temp;
            for(auto element:init){
                temp.push_back(element+1);
            }
            init+=(temp);
            //cout << init << endl;
        }
        return init[k-1];
    }
};
```

기초적인 풀이, 효율적이지 않음. 

아래와 같이 수학적인 접근 필요 

### Solution(binary shift) 
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char kthCharacter(int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        int t;
        while (k != 1) {
            t = __lg(k);
            if ((1 << t) == k) {
                t--;
            }
            k = k - (1 << t);
            ans++;
        }
        return 'a' + ans;
    }
};
```

GCC 내장함수를 이용, 

`__lg()` 는?

- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)에서 제공하는 비표준 내장 함수
- __lg(k) = floor(log₂(k))
- k보다 작거나 같은 가장 큰 2의 지수의 지수값을 반환
