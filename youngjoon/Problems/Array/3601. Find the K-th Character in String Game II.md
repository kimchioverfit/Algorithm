# 3601. Find the K-th Character in String Game II

Alice and Bob are playing a game. Initially, Alice has a string word = "a".
You are given a positive integer k. You are also given an integer array operations, where operations[i] represents the type of the ith operation.
Now Bob will ask Alice to perform all operations in sequence:

If operations[i] == 0, append a copy of word to itself.
If operations[i] == 1, generate a new string by changing each character in word to its next character in the English alphabet, and append it to the original word. For example, performing the operation on "c" generates "cd" and performing the operation on "zb" generates "zbac".

Return the value of the kth character in word after performing all the operations.
Note that the character 'z' can be changed to 'a' in the second type of operation.

> **Example 1**
>
> Input: k = 5, operations = [0,0,0]
> Output: "a"
> Explanation:
> Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the three operations as follows:
>
> Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
> Appends "aa" to "aa", word becomes "aaaa".
> Appends "aaaa" to "aaaa", word becomes "aaaaaaaa".
>
>

> **Example 2**
>
> Input: k = 10, operations = [0,1,0,1]
> Output: "b"
> Explanation:
> Initially, word == "a". Alice performs the four operations as follows:
>
> Appends "a" to "a", word becomes "aa".
> Appends "bb" to "aa", word becomes "aabb".
> Appends "aabb" to "aabb", word becomes "aabbaabb".
> Appends "bbccbbcc" to "aabbaabb", word becomes "aabbaabbbbccbbcc".
>
>
>

Constraints:

1 <= k <= 1014
1 <= operations.length <= 100
operations[i] is either 0 or 1.
The input is generated such that word has at least k characters after all operations.


### Solution
```cpp
    class Solution {
    public:
        // 안전한 log2 계산기
        int safe_log2(unsigned long long k) {
            int t = 0;
            while ((1ULL << (t + 1)) <= k) t++;
            return t;
        }

        // operations 기반 트리 경로 shift 계산
        char kthCharacter(unsigned long long k, const vector<int>& operations) {
            vector<int> path_indices;

            // 트리 경로 추적
            while (k != 1) {
                int t = safe_log2(k);
                if ((1ULL << t) == k) t--;
                k -= (1ULL << t);
                path_indices.push_back(t);
            }

            // 해당 경로에서 type 1만 카운트
            int shift = 0;
            for (int idx : path_indices) {
                if (idx < operations.size() && operations[idx] == 1) {
                    shift++;
                }
            }

            return (char)('a' + (shift % 26));
        }

        // 순수 트리 기반 빠른 버전
        char kthCharacter(int k) {
            int shift = 0;
            while (k != 1) {
                int t = __lg(k);
                if ((1 << t) == k) t--;
                k -= (1 << t);
                shift++;
            }
            return 'a' + shift;
        }
    };

```

방법을 떠올렸지만 시간 내에 제대로 구현하지 못함.

비트 연산에 대한 이해도 부족

또한, 비트 연산시의 Overflow, underflow가능성을 고려하지 않음.
